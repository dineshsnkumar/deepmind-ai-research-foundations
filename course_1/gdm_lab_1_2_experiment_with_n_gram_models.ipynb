In this lab, you will automatically estimate the probabilities for predicting the next word and build an **n-gram model** using a small dataset of paragraphs. This will result in a language model that will be able to predict the next word for a given prompt and that can be used to generate texts. You will also gain a practical understanding of how n-gram models capture language patterns and what the limitations of this family of models are. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for exploring more advanced language models in later modules."

        "Note that the space tokenizer is quite naive. When you are tokenizing based only on spaces, you will observe that the punctuation marks are often considered part of the words. For example, tokenizing the sentence \"Table mountain is tall.\"  will result in a different list of words than tokenizing \"Table mountain is tall\". The first sentence results in (`[\"Table\", \"mountain\", \"is\", \"tall.\"]`. The second sentence, which has the period missing from the end, will result in `[\"Table\", \"mountain\", \"is\", \"tall\"]`). Since the units that tokenizers split sequences into are not always a word, they are usually referred to as **tokens**. In many cases, a token will be the same as a word but it may also be non-word strings, such as \"tall.\" or \"3/4\".\n",

        "When moving from bigrams (pairs of tokens) to trigrams (triplets of tokens), the number of possible combinations increases exponentially, and many of these triplets rarely, if ever, appear in the dataset.

This makes it more challenging for the model to reliably predict the next token.\n",

        "\n",
        "**1. Functionality:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- You saw how n-gram models can be used to predict the next token in a sequence based on the preceding tokens (context).\n",
        "- N-gram models are relatively simple to implement by estimating conditional probabilities from n-gram counts in a dataset. These probabilities can then be used to repeatedly sample the next token and generate new continuations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Data sparsity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data sparsity is a major challenge for n-gram models, especially with higher-order n-grams (trigrams or larger).\n",
        "- This sparsity arises because many possible token combinations are rare or absent in real-world text data.\n",
        "- You observed this in the dataset. The dimensions of the trigram matrix are significantly larger than those of the bigram matrix, resulting in more zero values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Randomness and text generation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- While the model assigns probabilities to different next tokens, the actual choice is stochastic (random), resulting in different outputs for multiple runs.\n",
        "- While higher probabilities increase the chances of a token being picked, less frequent tokens can also be generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Considerations for text generation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The size of *n* can affect the quality of the generated text. Larger *n* might capture longer-range dependencies but can lead to data sparsity and repetitive outputs.\n",
        "- The model is unable to generate text following an n-gram that is not present in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next activity, you will reflect on some of the limitations of n-gram models and go on to compare them with more advanced models."
